# Project #3: Behavioral Cloning (Steering Angle)

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. It's a convolutional neural network that uses pictures from a forward-facing camera 
to predict steering angle for video-game car on a track. It uses behavioral cloning to approximate human judgement.

## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - Behavioral cloning
  - Convolutional neural networks
  - Neural networks, including deep neural networks and convolution neural networks
  - Data pre-processing, including normalization, color channels, and image manipulation using OpenCV and Matplotlib
  - Constructing and training neural networks using Keras
  - Logisitic classifiers, stochastic gradient descent, and back-propagation
  - Anti-overfitting techniques like dropout and L2 regularization
  - Training neural networks using a GPU on Amazon Web Services
